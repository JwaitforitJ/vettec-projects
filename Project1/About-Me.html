           <p>Allow me to tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
           <p>I'm your average Millennial. I enjoy avocados, travel, and playing video games. I’m what you might call an extroverted introvert. I work very well with others, and I enjoy meeting new people. Though I also enjoy hiding in my house and playing games, watching movies, or just hanging out with my dogs.</p>

    <p>These photos are all my personal pictures, taken through my travels. They tell a brief snippet of my story. I may no longer be in the military. I may not still live in Germany. I also may not get out as much as I used to. I still live a fulfilling life viewing the world from a different perspective.  </p>

<p>The first photo is of Eibsee lake in Germany on the Austrian boarder. This was my partner and I’s first real trip in Europe. It had the most beautiful blue water you could ever hope to see. Next we have a photo of me taken by a friend as I waited patiently to see off the aircraft so I could get the heck out of Romania. I was assisting in an annual NATO training mission. Training missions were the biggest part of my life for the three years I was in Germany. Next we have a sunset over our Apache helicopters in Norway. I had some the coolest experiences of my life on this mission. After that we have a photo of my partner and I at our Military ball. We were so fortunate to be stationed together the whole eight years I was active duty. She is obviously way cooler than me. Just look at that hat! Lastly we have two photos from London. Our very last vacation before the pandemic. The global panorama really messed up travel. First we have our trip to Harry Potter World. This is where much of the movies were filed. We got to see real life props, drink butterbeer and generally have an amazing time. I'm not the biggest HP fan but she is. So it goes without saying. It’s a big part of my life as well. Last we have a picture of the Thames from the top of the London Eye. As you can see, I love to travel and just enjoy life. We only get one, and nobody makes it out alive.     </p>
