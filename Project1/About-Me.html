            <p>Allow me to tell you a little bit about myself.</p>
            <p>A little about me. I am an Army veteran and Army spouse, currently living in Alabama. I spend my free time with my best friends (my dogs). If I'm not trying to keep up with them I'm playing video games on my pc, Xbox or Nintendo switch. Or maybe binge watching the most recent YouTube videos on my favorite channels. I'm a bit of an introvert but I make for some pretty decent entertainment if you can get me going. As you can see from the pictures below I love to travel and see as much of the world as possible I am an aspiring full stack developer learning the ins and outs of Java, JavaScript, Html, and Css. Trying to find my passion and purpose outside of the military.   </p>
            
 
            <p>I chose these photos to represent myself. The first photo is of Eibsee lake in Germany on the Austrian boarder. I love to travel and experience new places, cultures, and languages. This was our first real trip in Europe. It had the most beautiful blue water you could ever hope to see. Following that we have a photo of my spouse and I In our ASUs at a military ball. My spouse has been the most important thing in my life for over a decade now, and the Army was the second for a long time. She is obviously way cooler than me. Just look at that hat! Next We have a photo from our trip to Dortman Germany for a Pokemon Go festival. Again, I love to travel. More importantly I love to play Pokemon. I threw in a very attractive pc gaming setup. For the soul purpose of expressing how much I love my games, but also the hardware. If it wasn’t for a Youtube video or two teaching me how to work the handwear. I wouldn’t be where I am today. Lastly we have two photos from London. Our very last vacation before we came back to the states. First we have our trip to Harry Potter World. This is where much of the movies were filed. We got to see real life props, drink butterbeer and generally have an amazing time. I'm not the biggest HP fan but she is. So it goes without saying. It’s a big part of my life as well. Last we have a picture of the Thames from the top of the London Eye. Again, I love to travel and just enjoy life. We only get one, and nobody makes it out alive.     </p>
